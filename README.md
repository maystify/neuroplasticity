# Neuroplasticity - Breakthrough Junior Challenge

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains all the assets (animations, stills, voiceovers...) that I created and used within my Neuroplasticity video for the Science Breakthrough Junior Challenge. You can find this video at https://youtu.be/WrbaflYcbFY.

I created and designed all the animations in the video. First, I used Photoshop to draw/construct the parts and then used Premiere to manipulate them all into a cohesive animation. 

The video itself is made up of video files of me talking to the camera, voice-overs, and animation segments. 

In the folders above you can find everything I created: 
  - The **Animations** folder contains both simple/short animations and segments a bunch of smaller animations melded into one. You can find drafts of different animation I struggled with at first. 
  - The **Audio-files** folder contains all the voiceovers.
  - The **Stills** folder contains all the drawing/constructions that would eventually be manipulated to create an animation. 
  - The **Symbols** folder contains all other images. 
  
You can also find both versions of the script that I used whilst editing the video and the official Premiere timeline file (neuroplasticty-officialtimeline.prproj).

## Neurons & Reactions

![Neurons](screenshots/neurons.png?raw=true "Neurons")

This animation is a combination of a human waving and a signal going through neurons. I really wanted to highlight how neurons do absolutely everything for a human. I separated the arm from the body and moved it individually. The challenge was to make sure all the moving files coordinated well with each other and weren't too confusing.


## Neural Pathways

![Pathways](screenshots/pathways.png?raw=true "Pathways")

These animations were very significant because they showed how the number of signals going through your brain can strengthen your pathways. These were tedious-- I had to animate every pathway manually, making sure they followed the pathway cleanly, and then send the correct amount of 'signals' at a time. 

## Synapses

![Synapes](screenshots/synapse.png?raw=true "Synapses")

This animation was made to demonstrate how increased brain activity led to increasing neurotransmitters. It is a combination of two animations: the neural pathway and the synapse. The challenge was to create a unique trail for every neurotransmitter and represent the propagation of signals.
